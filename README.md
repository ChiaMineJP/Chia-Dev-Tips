# Chia Dev Tips

* I am writing the tips in lists to simplify descriptions
* With lists,  each sentence is naturally to be short and concise
  * Lists can be nested and good to show dependencies between the items
* In addition to using lists, I'll quote collections of real `chia-blockchain`code to offer better understanding in Chia Blockchain.
  * I often read the source code to recall how chia things work.
    * Opening various python files often makes me exhauseted.
    * Editors usually open a single tab for a single file so eye-following execution steps in the same file requires me to scroll up and down repeatedly.
    * This makes me difficult to read code blocks scattered in the same file
    * It will be nice if we can see those code blocks without remembering lines / files
    * I'll quote execution contexts in order from relevant code blocks in a page without consuming your brain memory to remember code locations
